### Summary of Projects
- [x] Project 1: [**Logic Gates**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P01-LogicGates) -> Starting from an elementary [NAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) logic gate, built an array of more complex logic gates, i.e., And, Or, Mux, Xor, etc..
- [x] Project 2: [**ALU**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P02-ALU) -> Constructed an adder chip and ALU, which executes all the arithmetic and logical operations.
- [x] Project 3: [**Registers & Program Counter**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P03-SequentialGates) -> Used a D [Flip Flop circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)), which enables storing state in a chip, to construct a series of registers and a [Program Counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter).
- [x] Project 4: **Assembly** -> Wrote Assembly Language programs using the Hack Machine Language.
- [x] Project 5: [**Full Computer**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P05-Computer) -> Constructued CPU, ROM, and RAM units leading to a full scale Computer.
- [x] Project 6: [**Assembler**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P6-Assembler) -> Created Hack assembler in Python to translate Hack Assembly Language into Hack Binary Machine Language.
- [x] Project 7 & 8: [**VM Translator**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P7%268-VMTranslator) -> Started Two-Tier compilation process by building Virtual Machine Translator of a Jave-like, stack-based Bytecode into Hack Assembly Language.
- [x] Project 10 [**Syntax Analysis**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P10-SyntaxAnalyzer): Created syntax analyzer, the first stage of the jack compiler, that parses a jack program and build a parse tree in xml format.
- [x] Project 11: [**Compiler**](https://github.com/notDroid/Nand2Tetris/tree/main/P11-JackCompiler) -> Finished two-tier compilation process by implementing compiler for translation of high-level Jack language into VM langauge, akin to Java bytecode.
