All tools used are avaliable at [Nand2Tetris Web IDE](https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip). Part 1 files not in this repo (done completely in ide).
### Summary of Projects
- [x] project 1: **Logic Gates** -> Starting from an elementary [NAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) logic gate, built an array of more complex logic gates, i.e., And, Or, Mux, Xor, etc.
- [x] project 2: **ALU** -> Constructed an adder chip and ALU, which executes all the arithmetic and logical operations
- [x] project 3: **Registers & Program Counter** -> Used a D [Flip Flop circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)), which enables storing state in a chip, to construct a series of registers and a [Program Counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter)
- [x] project 4: **Assembly** -> Wrote Assembly Language programs using the Hack Machine Language
- [x] project 5: **Full Computer** -> Constructued CPU, ROM, and RAM units leading to a full scale Computer
- [x] project 6: **Assembler** -> Created Hack assembler in Python to translate Hack Assembly Language into Hack Binary Machine Language
- [x] project 7 & 8: **VM Translator** -> Started Two-Tier compilation process by building Virtual Machine Translator of a Jave-like, stack-based Bytecode into Hack Assembly Language
- [x] project 10 & 11: **Compiler** -> Finished two-tier compilation process by implementing compiler for translation of high-level Jack language into VM langauge, akin to Java bytecode
